# Vue.js 
## What i was able to learn in one day

## Basics
I first heard about Vue about a week ago when we started learning React. It is a front-end tool that mashes some of Angular's directives with the structure and templating of React components

there are 2 ways to start using Vue. You can import the cdn or you can load it from the cli using npm or a simalar tools.
The cli install creates a set up very similar to Reat.js.

This was the project I attempted to recreate using the Vue cli setup
